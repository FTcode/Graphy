# Graphy

Graphy is an educational web app for visualising graph theory, written in Node (with the `express` and `sqlite3` modules).

Graphy has the functionality to:
 - Create weighted and unweighted graphs.
 - Save graphs to a server-side database (accessible by permalink), or export them as PNG images.
 - Check graphs for certain properties (Connected, Hamiltonian, Eulerian, Semi-Eulerian, etc).
 - Run algorithms on weighted graphs (Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Route Inspection).
